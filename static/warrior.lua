In traditional FFXI, warrior was a pretty boring job. It didn't bring a lot of skills to the table, 
was great for DPS, but overall subpar at everything else. Its playstyle was very straight forward, 
and I believe that this was intentional, for the most part. The reality is, a lot of the early melee,
 classes were simply straight forward and old in their design. If you compare them to SE's more recent
additions, such as Runefencer, you will see that Runefencer has a lot more gameplay involved in its
execution.

<br><br>

Fire in Vana'diel seeks to correct some of these dated design flaws by expanding the role of the warrior
within its own combat mechanics system. All the while, still leaving it as an easy to use "first class" 
for people who just need to get used to the game. An intro level class, not mechanically or intellectually
 challenging to play, but engaging and enjoyable for those that enjoy this type of play style.

   <tr>
      <td>Fury</td><td>1</td><td>Passive</td>
      <td>Fury is basically a new resource exclusively to Warriors. It is a resource in the same way that
 mana or tp is a resource. A warrior will gain Fury every time he or she receives or deals damage. The 
amount gained will be 20% of damage taken, or dealt, or 25 whichever is greater. Fury will be pushed 
to the client as mana. As such, it will be represented by the mana bar. However, things like mana
 equipment or refresh will not increase Fury.</td>
